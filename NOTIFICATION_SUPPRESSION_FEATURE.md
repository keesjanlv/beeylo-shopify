# Notification Suppression Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This feature allows store owners to control whether Shopify email notifications are suppressed for customers who opt to receive order updates through the Beeylo app.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Store Setting Toggle ✅

**Location:** `shopify_stores.settings` (JSONB column)

**New Setting:**
```json
{
  "suppress_shopify_notifications_for_beeylo_orders": true  // default: true
}
```

**Behavior:**
- `true` (default): Suppress Shopify shipping/fulfillment emails for Beeylo app orders
- `false`: Send both Shopify emails AND Beeylo app notifications (duplicate notifications)

---

### 2. Settings Management UI ✅

**File:** `shopify/src/views/store-settings.html`

**Features:**
- Beautiful toggle switch for notification suppression setting
- Real-time feedback showing what each setting does
- Auto-save functionality with loading states
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Loads current settings from database
- Additional toggles for:
  - Auto-sync orders
  - Send shipping updates
  - Send delivery updates

**Access URL:**
```
https://your-app.railway.app/store-settings?store_id=<STORE_ID>
```

---

### 3. API Endpoints ✅

#### GET `/api/stores/:store_id`
Fetch a specific store's settings (excluding sensitive access_token)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "store": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "shop_domain": "store.myshopify.com",
    "settings": {
      "auto_sync": true,
      "suppress_shopify_notifications_for_beeylo_orders": true,
      "send_shipping_updates": true,
      "send_delivery_updates": true
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

#### PUT `/api/stores/:store_id/settings`
Update store settings

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "suppress_shopify_notifications_for_beeylo_orders": false,
    "auto_sync": true,
    "send_shipping_updates": true,
    "send_delivery_updates": true
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "store": { ... }
}
```

---

### 4. Webhook Logic Update ✅

**File:** `shopify/src/services/webhook.service.ts`

**Function:** `handleFulfillmentCreate()`

**Logic:**
```typescript
// Check store settings
const suppressNotifications =
  store.settings?.suppress_shopify_notifications_for_beeylo_orders !== false;

if (!order.receive_in_app) {
  // Regular order - always send email
  await sendShippingNotification();
} else if (!suppressNotifications) {
  // Beeylo order, but store wants duplicate notifications
  await sendShippingNotification();
  await sendInAppShippingNotification();
} else {
  // Beeylo order with suppression enabled (default)
  await sendInAppShippingNotification(); // Only app notification
}
```

---

### 5. Automatic Order Tagging ✅

**File:** `shopify/src/services/webhook.service.ts`

**Function:** `handleOrderCreate()`

When a customer opts for Beeylo app delivery:
1. ✅ Order is automatically tagged with `"beeylo-app-delivery"`
2. ✅ Tag is visible in Shopify admin
3. ✅ Tag can be used by Shopify Flow or external fulfillment systems

**Benefits:**
- Easy identification of Beeylo orders in Shopify admin
- Supports Shopify Flow workflows
- Can be used by fulfillment services to set `notify_customer: false`

---

### 6. Shopify API Helper Functions ✅

**File:** `shopify/src/lib/shopify.ts`

**New Functions:**
```typescript
// Update order tags
updateOrderTags(shop, accessToken, orderId, tags)

// Add tag while preserving existing tags
addOrderTag(shop, accessToken, orderId, newTag)
```

---

## How It Works End-to-End

### Scenario 1: Notification Suppression ENABLED (Default)

```
1. Customer checks "Receive in Beeylo app" at cart
2. Order created in Shopify
3. ✅ Order confirmation email sent (mandatory)
4. Your webhook receives orders/create
5. ✅ Order tagged with "beeylo-app-delivery"
6. ✅ Order synced with receive_in_app=true
7. ✅ In-app notification sent
8. ❌ Email notification skipped

9. Merchant creates fulfillment
10. Your webhook receives fulfillments/create
11. System checks: suppressNotifications = true
12. ✅ In-app shipping notification sent
13. ❌ Shopify email notification suppressed

Result: Customer gets ONE notification (via app only)
```

### Scenario 2: Notification Suppression DISABLED

```
1. Customer checks "Receive in Beeylo app" at cart
2. Order created in Shopify
3. ✅ Order confirmation email sent (mandatory)
4. Your webhook receives orders/create
5. ✅ Order tagged with "beeylo-app-delivery"
6. ✅ Order synced with receive_in_app=true
7. ✅ In-app notification sent
8. ❌ Email notification skipped

9. Merchant creates fulfillment
10. Your webhook receives fulfillments/create
11. System checks: suppressNotifications = false
12. ✅ In-app shipping notification sent
13. ✅ Shopify email notification ALSO sent

Result: Customer gets TWO notifications (via app AND email)
```

### Scenario 3: Regular Order (No Beeylo Checkbox)

```
1. Customer does NOT check "Receive in Beeylo app"
2. Order created in Shopify
3. ✅ Order confirmation email sent
4. Your webhook receives orders/create
5. ✅ Order synced with receive_in_app=false
6. ✅ Email notification sent (regular flow)

7. Merchant creates fulfillment
8. Your webhook receives fulfillments/create
9. System checks: order.receive_in_app = false
10. ✅ Shopify email notification sent (always)

Result: Customer gets notifications via email (standard Shopify flow)
```

## Important Notes

### What Can Be Suppressed ❌

| Notification Type | Can Suppress? | Why |
|------------------|---------------|-----|
| Order Confirmation | ❌ No | Shopify requirement - mandatory for customer protection |
| Shipping Confirmation | ✅ Yes | Your integration controls this via `notify_customer: false` |
| Fulfillment Updates | ✅ Yes | Your integration controls this |

### Setting Behavior

**When `suppress_shopify_notifications_for_beeylo_orders = true` (default):**

- No Shopify shipping/fulfillment emails

2. **Flexibility**: Can keep duplicate notifications if desired
3. **Easy Toggle**: Simple UI to change setting anytime

## Developer Notes

### Adding More Settings

To add new store settings:

1. Add to default settings in `api.routes.ts`:
```typescript
const updatedSettings = {
  ...existingSettings,
  new_setting_name: settings.new_setting_name !== false,
};
```

2. Add toggle to `store-settings.html`:
```html
<div class="setting-item">
  <div class="setting-header">
    <div class="setting-label">
      <h3>New Setting Name</h3>
      <p>Description...</p>
    </div>
    <label class="toggle-switch">
      <input type="checkbox" id="new-setting">
      <span class="toggle-slider"></span>
    </label>
  </div>
</div>
```

3. Update JavaScript to load/save the setting

### Checking Settings in Code

```typescript
// In webhook handler or service
const store = await db.getStoreByDomain(shopDomain);
const mySetting = store.settings?.my_setting_name !== false;

if (mySetting) {
  // Setting is enabled
} else {
  // Setting is disabled
}
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Setting Not Saving

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors

- Missing settings parameter in request
- Database connection issues

### Notifications Still Being Sent

**Check:**
1. Verify setting is enabled in database
2. Check webhook handler logs
3. Verify order has `receive_in_app = true`
4. Check fulfillment creation logs
5. Ensure notification service respects setting

### UI Not Loading Settings

**Check:**
1. API endpoint `/api/stores/:store_id` returns settings
