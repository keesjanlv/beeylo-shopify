## üîß Post-Deployment Steps

After deploying to any service, follow these steps:

### 1. Update Shopify App URLs

Go to Shopify Partners Dashboard:
1. Navigate to your app
2. Go to "App setup"
3. Update:
   - **App URL**: `https://your-production-url.com`
   - **Allowed redirection URLs**: `https://your-production-url.com/auth/callback`
4. Click "Save"

### 2. Test Webhooks

1. Create a test order in your Shopify store
2. Check the `webhook_events` table in Supabase:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM webhook_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```
3. Verify `processed = true` and no errors

### 3. Verify Database Connection

```sql
-- Check if store is connected
SELECT * FROM shopify_stores WHERE is_active = true;

-- Check recent orders
SELECT * FROM shopify_orders ORDER BY synced_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Monitor Logs

In Railway/Render/DigitalOcean:
- Go to "Logs" tab
- Watch for any errors
- Ensure webhooks are being received

### 5. Update Dashboard

Update your dashboard's `.env` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_URL=https://your-production-url.com
```

Redeploy your dashboard (if on Vercel):
```bash
cd dashboardapp
vercel --prod
```

## üîí Security Checklist

Before going to production:

- [ ] All sensitive keys are in environment variables (not in code)
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (automatic with Railway/Render)
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies are enabled
- [ ] Webhook secret is strong and random
- [ ] Rate limiting is considered (if expecting high traffic)
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] No API keys are logged or exposed

---

## üìà Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks

Set up monitoring for your production service:

**Railway/Render**: Both provide built-in monitoring

**External Options**:
- UptimeRobot (free): https://uptimerobot.com
- Pingdom
- StatusCake

Monitor this endpoint:
```
GET https://your-production-url.com/health
```

### Log Rotation

For production, consider:
1. Using a logging service (Logtail, Papertrail)
2. Setting up log rotation
3. Monitoring error rates

### Database Maintenance

Weekly tasks:
```sql
-- Clean up old webhook events (older than 30 days)
DELETE FROM webhook_events WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Check for failed syncs
SELECT * FROM webhook_events WHERE processed = false;

-- Monitor notification queue
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_notifications WHERE sent = false;
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Production Issues

### Webhooks Not Working

1. **Check URL is accessible**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-production-url.com/health
   ```

2. **Verify webhook signature**
   - Check `webhook_events` table for HMAC errors
   - Ensure `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches in both places

3. **Check Shopify Dashboard**
   - Go to Partners ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí API calls
   - Look for webhook delivery failures

### Database Connection Issues

1. **Verify service role key**
   ```bash
   # Test connection
   curl https://xcuvffwuyrdmufvgzczs.supabase.co/rest/v1/shopify_stores \
     -H "apikey: YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
   ```

2. **Check RLS policies**
   - Ensure service_role policies are set to `USING (true)`

### Server Not Starting

1. **Check logs** in your hosting platform
2. **Verify all environment variables** are set
3. **Ensure PORT** is correct (use Railway/Render's default)
4. **Check build command** completed successfully

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| Service | Free Tier | Paid Start | Best For |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Railway** | 500 hrs/month | $5/mo | Quick deployment |
| **Render** | 750 hrs/month | $7/mo | Reliability |
| **DigitalOcean** | No free tier | $5/mo | Scaling |
| **Heroku** | No free tier | $7/mo | Established apps |

**Recommendation**: Start with **Railway** or **Render** free tier, then upgrade based on usage.

---

## üéØ Scaling Considerations

When you outgrow basic hosting:

### For 100+ stores:
- Add Redis for caching
- Use background job queues (Bull/BullMQ)
- Separate webhook processing to workers

### For 1000+ stores:
- Horizontal scaling (multiple instances)
- Database read replicas
- CDN for static assets
- Load balancer

### For 10,000+ stores:
- Microservices architecture
- Kubernetes deployment
- Dedicated Postgres instance
- Advanced monitoring (Datadog, New Relic)
